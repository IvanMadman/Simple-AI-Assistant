Add an AI-powered chatbot to your WordPress site using OpenAI's GPT models. Customizable, secure, and GDPR-compliant.

== Description ==

Simple AI Assistant integrates an intelligent chatbot into your WordPress website, powered by OpenAI's advanced GPT models. This plugin offers a seamless way to provide instant, AI-driven support and engagement for your visitors.
The user can request the deletion of his data and the plugin will automatically anonymize it without any manual action needed on your side.
With the possibility to give it awareness of the webpage it's hosted on and memory of previous messages, you can give your bot a lot of knowledge. 
Always remember to put a limit and check your token usage, the context option is very powerful but the expense can grow very fast.
